# Vim dotfiles

This is my personnal (n)vim config, feel free to override it!
I only update the neovim one.

## Languages bindings
I mostly work with a few languages and I adapted my config to work with :
 - C
 - C++
 - Rust

 I also plan to add support for others, so be on the lookout!

## Add your custom config

The main config file includes the .vim.local config. If you need to add your own config, use this file.
